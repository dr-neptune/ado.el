* 👾 Introduction
This package provides an Emacs interface to Azure DevOps boards. You can:
- View recent tickets (non-closed, last 90 days)
- Create new tickets
- Update existing tickets

All from the comfort of an Emacs buffer, with an 80s hacker console twist!

* 🚨 Warning
*This library is in extremely early stages.* It modifies data within your Azure DevOps instance, so please use it *at your own risk*.

* 🛠 Setup
1. Place =azure-devops.el= in your load-path or use a package manager.
2. Add this to your Emacs config:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/this/package")
    (setq azure-devops-username "username@email.com")
    (setq azure-devops-organization-url "https://dev.azure.com/org-name-here/")
    (setq azure-devops-project-name "")
    (setq azure-devops-pat "YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN")

    (require 'azure-devops)

    ;; Optionally bind the menu to something like "C-c d"
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") #'azure-devops-menu)
  #+END_SRC

Make sure your Personal Access Token (PAT) has the appropriate scopes (e.g., Work Items: Read/Write).

* 💿 Usage
Once installed and configured:

1. *Invoke the Hydra menu* via:
   - #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x azure-devops-menu
     ;; or if you set a keybinding:
     C-c d
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. *Pick a command* from the Hydra:
   - =t= :: View Recent Tickets
   - =u= :: Update Ticket
   - =c= :: Create Ticket
   - =q= :: Quit the menu

* 🕹 View Recent Tickets
- Displays an Org buffer with tickets from the last 90 days (non-Closed).
- Organized into “Current Sprint” vs. “Backlog” sections.

* 💾 Create Ticket
- Prompts you for:
  1. Work Item Type (Enhancement or Bug)
  2. Title
  3. Description in a temporary Org buffer (=C-c C-c= to confirm)
  4. Story Points

- Creates the new ticket in Azure DevOps and displays a success message with the ticket ID.

* 🖥 Update Ticket
- Prompts you for a substring of the ticket’s Title.
- Displays matching results for you to pick from.
- Opens the chosen ticket in an Org buffer. You can edit fields, then press =C-c C-c= to PATCH (update) the ticket.
